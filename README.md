# Discord-Bot-JS

This is the second version of my Discord bot for a group chat that I'm in.  

The first version was in Python, and I originally chose Python because I wanted to work on my Python skills, but I switched to Node (my primary language) after seeing how much more mature the Node Discord package was than the Python.  

Also, the docs for the Node package are much better.

The bot does a few things:

It responds to certain phrases.

It can look-up words when asked: 'define programming'.

When a user posts a Soundcloud, Spotify, or YouTube link, then it will extract the relevant information (url, title, description, artist, etc) and send it to a database.  This data is used to populate a GUI for easy viewing so that we can see a record of the media that has been posted.
